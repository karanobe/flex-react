### What problem is it solving?
FLEX allows users to find gym buddies! Users can answer a few quick quesitons, including their gym location and workout buddy preferences and find others nearby who are looking to make friends and help each other stay accountable.

Once you are able to search for "flex-mates," you can send a request to connect as friends and start texting with each other!

### Features
- Seach for locaitons using built in Google Maps search box
- Build a profile outlining your health goals
- Upload profile photos
- Enter preferences and filter
- Peruse matching profiles
- Send a friend request with someone you want to work out with
- Once you're connected, start texting

### Precautions
Privacy is important when sharing information on the internet. Users cannot see any personal information of any fellow users. A robust registration gem (Devise) was implemented in order to protect users. Beyond that, Twilio is used for messaging only after two users decide to connect. Twilio keeps contact information anonymous.

### Future Features
- Swiping
- Rate/review users after a workout
- Geolocation
- Native app
- In-app communiction
